# Terraria Fishing Bot

Terraria Fishing Bot is a program that uses image recognition to fish automatically in Terraria. The script uses [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) and [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) to scan the screen of any text that come from fishing while using a sonar potion.

## Getting Started

1. Download the RAR file from the releases section.
2. Extract the contents into a directory where you have write permissions.
3. Run `Fishing Bot.exe` to start the program.

## Instructions/How to use

* Be sure to have the game in fullscreen or borderless mode and keep UI scale at 100% .
* Keep the fishing area well lit and avoid anything that may obstruct the text the sonar potion such as the mouse cursor.
* Make sure the Quick Buff control is binded to `B` in keybinds.
* Once selecting the catches, select your fishing rod of choice and right click on the fishing spot and wait until the bot casts the fishing rod.

## Why did I make this?

When I was playing Terraria with my friends for multiple playthroughs, I would always be the resident fisherman. I would be the one to catch fish to make buff potions and especially wormhole potions. After multiple playthroughs, it gets a bit tedious doing the same thing over and over again. So I created this fishing bot to fish automatically for me.
